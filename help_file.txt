**For the application to work properly, please make sure that the column headers in each of your sheets are labeled appropriately.**


How to use the application:
===========================
First, in the "URL of the Google Sheet" box, enter the URL (website address) of the google sheet you wish to process
    - we recommend copy & pasting.
Then, enter the sheet names of each individual sheet in this google sheet you would like to process (separated by commas)
    - This will be the names you click on at the bottom of the webpage to switch between sheets
    - For example, for your spreadsheet "2024 WayStation First Time Guests Form (Responses)", you would want to enter:
        Form Responses 1, Form Responses 2, Form Responses 3, Form Responses 4
Next, you will use the "Desired Report Type" dropdown menu to select which report type you would like to generate:
    - Either New Guest, Welcome Back, or Exit
After that, you will enter the URL (website address) of a Google Sheet you would like the data to be added to
    - Again we recommend copy/pasting this URL
    - It will add the data starting at the first empty row, so if there is already data in the spreadsheet, the new
        data will be added below that.
Finally, you will need to select a date range you would like totals for.
    - You can use the "start date"/"end date" dropdown menus to select any custom date range
        - Make sure that the "From Selection" button is selected if you choose this option
    - Alternatively, for YTD numbers, you can select 'Current Year',
        and for this month's numbers, you would select 'Current Month'

Once you have filled in all the requisite fields, simply click the "Go" button, and the data will be processed!



I would just like to stress that the application we made for you will not work as intended unless the columns are named to describe what they 
contain (e.g. 'first name'). 

Ideally, the columns in each sheet would have the exact same name as every other sheet. For example, if one sheet has a column named 
"Do you need a bicycle?" and in another sheet, this column is only called "Bicycle", the application will total the two columns separately.

If you are getting any strange results, this is the first place I would look. We are unable to predict changing or deleted column names, 
so there is not much I can do about it from here.
